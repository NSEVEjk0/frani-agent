/**
 * test-balance-outage-unit.mjs — offline proof that a wallet-api outage is never
 * mistaken for a zero balance, and never blamed on the min-balance floor.
 *
 * `payments.assets()` resolves with an EMPTY ARRAY when the wallet-api cannot be
 * reached. It does not throw. So at the call site an outage and a genuinely empty
 * wallet are indistinguishable — and this agent had two places that read the
 * silence as a balance of zero:
 *
 *   1. `_send()` — the floor check saw `0 - amount < floor` and returned
 *      `{skipped: 'min-balance floor'}`. Under the refund-truth contract that is
 *      reported honestly to the payer ("could not return it — still owed to
 *      you"), so no money was ever misreported. But the *reason* was a fiction:
 *      the wallet held 100 UCT, and the agent said it was too poor to refund.
 *      An operator reading that log would go looking for the wrong problem.
 *   2. `bootstrapMintIfNeeded()` — saw 0 < floor and would mint a *second*
 *      bootstrap onto an already-funded wallet.
 *
 * This was observed live on 2026-08-27/28 across the fleet: balances read 0 while
 * the wallets actually held funds.
 *
 * The fix is `_coinRow()`, which reports whether a row came back at all, so
 * silence can be handled as silence. `_send` still fails closed — it just says
 * why truthfully, and `refundOutcome` passes any skip reason through unchanged.
 *
 * Offline: the SphereClient constructor takes an injected `sphere`, so no network,
 * no wallet and no funds are involved.
 *
 * Gitignored by default (test-*.mjs) and negated explicitly. Run:
 *   node test-balance-outage-unit.mjs
